Mods are added via URL to a .pak or .zip containing a .pak. Mods can also be pulled from mod.io.
Examples:

 - `C:\Path\To\Local\Mod.zip`
 - `https://example.org/some-online-mod-repository/public-mod.pak`
 - `https://mod.io/g/drg/m/sandbox-utilities`

## Usage

This section assumes that you are on Windows and is using the steam version of DRG, working with
either local `.pak`s or mod.io mods.

First, download the [latest release](https://github.com/Fedottt-Bo/mint-no-tag/releases/latest)
compatible with your architecture. For windows, this will be the `mint-no-tag.exe`. Extract
this to anywhere you'd like to keep the executable.
